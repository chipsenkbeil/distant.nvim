Distant.nvim is a plugin for working with remote machines. It enables you to
read, write, and execute from the comfort of your local machine and serves as
an alternative to `ssh` and `mosh` sessions that rely on installing and
running neovim directly on the remote machine.

INTRODUCTION                                            *distant-introduction*

Welcome to the neovim plugin built around the Lua bindings for distant, a set
of tooling and libraries dedicated to interaction with remote machines.

In order to operate against a remote machine, you first need to establish a
connection to it. To do this, you run `:DistantLaunch {host}` where the host
points to the remote machine and can be an IP address like `127.0.0.1` or a
domain like `example.com`.

The launch command will attempt to SSH into the remote machine using port 22
by default and start an instance of the distant server.

Once started, all remote operations will be sent to that machine! You can try
out something simple like displaying a list of files, directories, and
symlinks by running `:DistantOpen /some/dir`, which will open a dialog that
displays all of the contents of the specified directory.

==============================================================================
QUICK START                                               *distant-quickstart*

Using packer.nvim (https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim), the quickest
way to get up and running is the following:
>
  use {
    'chipsenkbeil/distant.nvim',
    config = function()
      require('distant').setup {
        -- Applies Chip's personal settings to every machine you connect to
        --
        -- 1. Ensures that distant servers terminate with no connections
        -- 2. Provides navigation bindings for remote directories
        -- 3. Provides keybinding to jump into a remote file's parent directory
        ['*'] = require('distant.settings').chip_default()
      }
    end
  }
<
The above will initialize the plugin with the following:

1. Any spawned distant server will shutdown after 60 seconds of inactivity
2. Standard keybindings are assigned for remote buffers (described below)

Within a file:~

{lhs}       {rhs}
--------    -----------------------------------
-           lua |distant.nav.actions.up()|

Within a directory:~

{lhs}       {rhs}
--------    -----------------------------------
<Return>    lua |distant.nav.actions.edit()|
-           lua |distant.nav.actions.up()|
K           lua |distant.nav.actions.mkdir()|
N           lua |distant.nav.actions.newfile()|
R           lua |distant.nav.actions.rename()|
D           lua |distant.nav.actions.remove()|

==============================================================================
INSTALLATION                                            *distant-installation*

This plugin acts as a wrapper around the Lua bindings to distant's core and
ssh libraries. In order for this library to function, `distant_lua.so` (or
`distant_lua.dll` for Windows) must be placed in the lua directory of this
plugin.

Sound complicated? Not to worry! This plugin provides support to automatically
install the shared library for you and will automatically begin the dialog
when you first attempt to invoke a command or function associated with
distant.

You can trigger the installation dialog manually by running `:DistantInstall`.
>
  1. Download a prebuilt lib
  2. Build from source
  3. Copy local lib
<
Download a prebuilt lib~

Selecting this option will query Github releases for the latest batch,
downloading the release you select. The specific library will be downloaded
based on the detected operation system and architecture of your local machine. 

For instance, an M1 Mac will download `distant_lua-macos-arm.dylib` whereas a
Linux machine will download `distant_lua-linux64-gnu.so`. The library
downloaded will be renamed to work with this plugin.

This requires that your machine have `curl`, `wget`, or `fetch` installed and
available on your path.

Build from source~

Selecting this option will download the latest copy of the distant repository
from https://github.com/chipsenkbeil/distant.

Once downloaded, the source will be built using `cargo build --release` and the
resulting shared library will be copied into the appropriate location.

This requires that your machine have both `git` and `cargo` installed.
Additionally, due to the build requirements of distant's library, you will
also need `perl` to build a vendored copy of `openssh`.

Copy local lib~

Selecting this option will prompt for the path to a `so`, `dylib`, or `dll` to
copy to the lua directory of this plugin.

==============================================================================
COMMANDS                                                    *distant-commands*

This plugin provides vim commands that can be used to initiate different tasks
remotely. It also includes specialized commands such as `DistantLaunch` that is
used to start a remote session.

Commands support {positional} and {key=value} pairs. Positional arguments are
relative to each other and are not influenced by key=value pairs inbetween.
>
  :DistantLaunch example.com mode=ssh ssh.user=name ssh.port=2222
<
Commands also support quoted strings as values such as
>
  :DistantLaunch example.com distant.args="--log-file distant.log --log-level trace"
<

Specialized commands~

These commands are geared towards performing actions that expose some dialogs
or other user interfaces within neovim.

DistantOpen {path} {opts}                                        *DistantOpen*

    Opens a file for editing or a directory for navigation.

    The open command accepts a path as its first argument and then an optional
    series of named parameters in the form of `name=value`.

    Options: ~
        {buf}       (number)   if provided, will replace the specified buffer
                               with the contents of the file or directory at
                               the specified path (default: 0)
        {reload}   (boolean)   if true, will reload the buffer by performing a
                               network query to get the file or directory 
                               contents (default: false)
        {timeout}   (number)   maximum time in milliseconds before failing
                               (default: settings.max_timeout)
        {interval}  (number)   approximate time in milliseconds between each
                               check to see if the operation completed
                               (default: settings.timeout_interval)

    Examples: ~
>
        :DistantOpen /path/to/file
        :DistantOpen "some path/with spaces"
        :DistantOpen /path/to/file reload=true
<

DistantLaunch {host} {opts}                                    *DistantLaunch*

                                   either "distant" or "ssh". When distant,
                                   this command will ssh into the host,
                                   spawn `distant listen`, and connect to
                                   the server over TCP to communicate requests
                                   like reading and writing. When ssh, this
                                   command will ssh into the host and maintain
                                   the ssh connection, using an sftp channel
                                   alongside exec channels to read and write
                                   (default: "distant")
        {ssh.user}       (string)  alternative user for connecting to the ssh

SETTINGS                                                    *distant-settings*

Engaging with remote machines can require some specific configuration per
host. To that end, distant.nvim provides the ability to define settings across
all or individual hosts and supports overriding previously-defined settings.

Defining settings is done by calling `require('distant').setup({opts})`:
>
  require('distant').setup {
    -- Any settings defined here are applied to all hosts
    ['*'] = {},

    -- Any settings defined here are applied only to example.com
    ['example.com'] = {},
  }
<

distant.setup({opts})                                        *distant.setup()*

    Defines the global settings for use with this plugin.

    Parameters: ~
        {opts}   (string) -> (table)  settings associated with this plugin,
                                      keyed by host name whose value is
                                      the associated options for that host
                                      (default: {})

    Options: ~
        {ssh}              (SshOpts)  ssh settings (default: {})
        {distant}      (DistantOpts)  distant server settings (default: {})
        {mode}              (string)  execution mode to use as a client, being
                                      either "distant" or "ssh". When distant,
                                      this command will ssh into the host,
                                      spawn `distant listen`, and connect to
                                      the server over TCP to communicate
                                      requests like reading and writing.
                                      When ssh, this command will ssh into
                                      the host and maintain the ssh
                                      connection, using an sftp channel

NAVIGATION                                                *distant-navigation*

When using distant.nvim, one of the most common needs is to navigate between
files and directories. The obvious way to do this is by using the command
|DistantOpen|, which will load or reopen the appropriate buffer matching the
file or directory. However, this can get cumbersome to do repeatedly. Luckily,
this plugin provides another way to navigate around remote machines!

Similar to the experience found using netrw + vim-vinegar or vim-dirvish,
distant.nvim offers an experience where you can jump into a directory view
and perform operations such as creating files & directories, renaming files,
and opening up files within local buffers.

This functionality is made available through `distant.nav.actions`, which
exposes a series of Lua functions that enable you to navigate and manipulate
your filesystem. These functions are designed to be assigned to key mappings
that are placed on remote file and directory buffers.

Navigation action functions~

distant.nav.actions.edit({opts})                  *distant.nav.actions.edit()*

    Opens the a file or directory, using the path denoted by the line under
    the cursor.

    1. In the case of a file, it is loaded into a buffer
    2. In the case of a directory, the navigator enters it

LUA API                                                      *distant-lua-api*

Blocking Functions~

Synchronous functions are available that perform the given operation in a
blocking fashion. Each function takes a single argument, which is a table
containing the arguments relevant for the function. Each function returns two
values: err being a string or false, and result being the results of the
function call if it has any (like file text).

>
  local fn = require('distant.fn')

  local err, text = fn.read_file_text({path = 'path/to/file'})
  if err then
    vim.api.nvim_err_writeln(err)
    return
  end

  print('Read file contents', text)
<

Asynchronous Functions~

Every blocking function can also be called in a non-blocking fashion. This is
done by supplying a callback function as the last argument.

>
  local fn = require('distant.fn')

  fn.read_file_text({path = 'path/to/file'}, function(err, text)
    if err then
      vim.api.nvim_err_writeln(err)
      return
    end

    print('Read file contents', text)
  end)

FAQ                                                              *distant-faq*

How does this plugin differ from using neovim with sshfs?  *distant-faq-sshfs*

  There are a couple of the primary differences that come to mind:

    1. `Filesystem`: sshfs is built using FUSE, meaning that you need support
    for it as a userland filesystem. distant.nvim requires no special
    filesystem as the file contents are only reflected in buffers. Anything
    you read goes into a buffer and anything you write gets transmitted across
    the network directly through the distant library.

    2. `Program locations`: distant supports running programs on the remote
    machine, colocated with your files. Language servers would run on the
    remote machine, for instance. When using sshfs to mount the remote file
    system on your local machine, you would then run programs locally and
    point them to the mounted files.

    With distant, you are leveraging the resources of a remote machine. This
    can be advantageous if you want to perform CPU or GPU intensive operations
    without heavily impacting your local machine. With sshfs, you are
    leveraging the resources of a local machine for programs that you run.
    Depending on what you're doing, this can be much more expensive.

    If a program needs to access the filesystem frequently, this would
    transmit a lot of requests over the network, especially if working over a
    large set of files. With distant, all of the filesystem operations would
    happen directly on the remote machine and only the program's output would
    be transmitted over the network.

  There are other technical differences, but the distinctions above are - at
  the moment - the differences that stand out. In some cases, using sshfs
  might be preferred, but for my use personally and at work this is the
  preferred method. :)

  If you want to think of what this more closely relates to, then take a look
  at VS Code Remote Development or the formerly-active Nuclide project.
